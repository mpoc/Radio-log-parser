Radio log parser
================
This program parses log files from the program "Radio player pro". It gathers data about the songs (artist and title, the number of times it was played on the radio throughout the log file, the total playing time of one song), then matches and adds data from an excel database to each song (album name, record label, ISRC identifier). Finally, a concise data summary of the songs is presented in an excel file.

The program has an easy-to-use GUI, including drag-and-drop functionality. An example of how the program is used can be found [here](https://youtu.be/lsHaLufNVrs).

Please keep in mind that I coded this project before I had started using Git. This is why the all the code is added in one big, practically undigestable commit.
